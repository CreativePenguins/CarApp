Android + Java + Car Maintenance Tracker

WheelWell is a mobile application that allows users to track maintenance and receive reminders for repairs. In order to receive car specific reminders, the user will input the make and model upon initial set up. Maintenance history will be tracked based on input from the user each time maintenance was performed on the car. Mileage will also be tracked by user input, either on a weekly or daily basis. The application will provide the user with reminders for make and model specific repairs, and to input mileage on a regular basis. 

Based on this mileage input, the application will calculate the amount of miles driven since last repair (i.e. oil change) and send a reminder to the user to get the specific maintenance done on the vehicle. 

The application will require an Android device with an internet connection.  

Minimum API 16 Android Jelly Bean 4.1
